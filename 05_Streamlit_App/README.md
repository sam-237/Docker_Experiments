Deploying a Streamlit App Using Docker 🐳📊
In this guide, we will walk through the process of deploying a Streamlit application using Docker. Docker is a powerful platform that allows you to containerize applications, making them portable and independent of the underlying system. Streamlit, on the other hand, is an open-source framework that enables you to create and share beautiful, interactive web apps for machine learning and data science.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Streamlit app running inside a Docker container, accessible via your web browser. 🌐

Prerequisites 📋
Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
Python: A programming language used to write the Streamlit application.
Streamlit: A framework for building interactive web apps with Python.
Documentation 📚
For more information, refer to the official documentation:

Docker Documentation
Streamlit Documentation
Docker Desktop Documentation
Installation 🛠️
Step 1: Install Streamlit
To install Streamlit, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install streamlit
Step 2: Install Docker Desktop
Download and install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website. Once installed, start Docker Desktop and ensure it is running.

Verify Installations ✅
Before proceeding, let's verify that Docker and Python are installed correctly.

Check Docker Version

Run the following command in your terminal:

docker --version
You should see an output similar to:

Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
Check Python Version

Run the following command in your terminal:

python --version
You should see an output similar to:

Python 3.9.7
Create the Streamlit Application 🐍
Let’s create a simple Streamlit application. Save the following code in a file named streamlit_app.py:

from collections import namedtuple
import altair as alt
import math
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

"""
# Welcome to Streamlit! 🎉

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire :heart:

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

with st.echo(code_location='below'):
   total_points = st.slider("Number of points in spiral", 1, 5000, 2000)
   num_turns = st.slider("Number of turns in spiral", 1, 100, 9)

   Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
   data = []

   points_per_turn = total_points / num_turns

   for curr_point_num in range(total_points):
      curr_turn, i = divmod(curr_point_num, points_per_turn)
      angle = (curr_turn + 1) * 2 * math.pi * i / points_per_turn
      radius = curr_point_num / total_points
      x = radius * math.cos(angle)
      y = radius * math.sin(angle)
      data.append(Point(x, y))

   st.altair_chart(alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame(data), height=500, width=500)
      .mark_circle(color='#0068c9', opacity=0.5)
      .encode(x='x:Q', y='y:Q'))
This application creates an interactive spiral visualization using Streamlit and Altair. 🌀

Create the Dockerfile 📄
A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for Docker to build an image. Create a file named Dockerfile (no file extension) in the same directory as streamlit_app.py and add the following content:

# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Clone the Streamlit example repository
RUN git clone https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-example.git .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 8501 for Streamlit
EXPOSE 8501

# Health check to ensure the app is running
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health

# Set the entrypoint command to run the Streamlit app
ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "streamlit_app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
This Dockerfile does the following:

Uses the official Python 3.9 slim image as the base.
Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.
Installs system dependencies required for Streamlit.
Clones the Streamlit example repository.
Installs Python dependencies from requirements.txt.
Exposes port 8501 for the Streamlit app.
Adds a health check to ensure the app is running.
Sets the entrypoint command to run the Streamlit app.
Build the Docker Image 🏗️
Now that we have our Dockerfile and streamlit_app.py, let's build the Docker image.

Open a terminal in the directory containing the Dockerfile and streamlit_app.py. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t streamlit_app .
The -t flag tags the image with the name streamlit_app.
The . at the end specifies the build context (current directory).
Verify the Docker Image 🖼️
After building the image, let's verify that it was created successfully.

Run the following command:

docker images
You should see an output similar to:

REPOSITORY      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
streamlit_app   latest    abc123def456   10 seconds ago   1.02GB
Run the Docker Container 🚀
Finally, let's run the Docker container to execute our Streamlit app.

Run the following command:

docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit_app
The -p flag maps port 8501 on your local machine to port 8501 in the container.
The streamlit_app is the name of the Docker image. Once the container is running, open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8501
You should see your Streamlit app running! 🎉

Conclusion 🎉
Congratulations! 🎉 You’ve successfully deployed a Streamlit application using Docker. This setup ensures that your app is portable, scalable, and independent of the underlying system. Docker and Streamlit together provide a powerful combination for building and deploying data-driven applications.

Keep exploring and building more complex applications with Docker and Streamlit! 🚀🐳
