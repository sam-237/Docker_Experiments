🐳 Docker Volume Logging App (Persistent Logs)
In this project, we'll demonstrate how to use Docker volumes to persist log data generated by a Python application. This is useful for applications that need to write logs or data that should survive even if the container is removed or restarted.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a Dockerized Python app that logs messages every 5 seconds into a shared /logs volume on your host. 🔁📁

📋 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

Docker installed
👉 Install Docker

Docker Desktop (recommended for beginners)
👉 Install Docker Desktop

🗂️ Project Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
03_Docker_Volume/
├── app.py            # Python logging script
├── Dockerfile        # Docker instructions
└── README.md         # You are here!
🐍 Step 1: Create the Python Logging App
Your app logs a message every 5 seconds into a log file:

python
Copy
Edit
# app.py

import time
import logging

# Set up logging to a file inside the volume
logging.basicConfig(filename='/logs/app.log', level=logging.INFO)

while True:
    logging.info(f'Logging a new entry at {time.ctime()}')
    time.sleep(5)
🔍 Explanation:
Logs are written to /logs/app.log

The infinite loop simulates a continuously running process

Logging is configured with INFO level

🐋 Step 2: Create the Dockerfile
Here is the Dockerfile to containerize the app and prepare the volume:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Use a minimal Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your app into the container
COPY app.py /app/

# Create a directory for logs
RUN mkdir -p /logs 

# Run the app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
🧪 Step 3: Build the Docker Image
Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
Build the image with:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t volume-logger .
Explanation:

-t volume-logger: Tags the image with the name volume-logger

. means Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the current directory

💽 Step 4: Run the Container with a Volume
To persist logs, mount a volume from your host system:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -v "$(pwd)/logs:/logs" --name logger volume-logger
🔍 Explanation:
-d: Run container in detached mode

-v "$(pwd)/logs:/logs": Mounts a volume from your current directory (logs/) to /logs inside the container

--name logger: Names the container "logger"

📄 Step 5: Check the Log Output
You can view the logs directly from your host system!

bash
Copy
Edit
cat logs/app.log
You should see output like:

less
Copy
Edit
INFO:root:Logging a new entry at Sun Aug 3 21:00:01 2025
INFO:root:Logging a new entry at Sun Aug 3 21:00:06 2025
🛑 Step 6: Stop & Restart Container (Logs Persist!)
Try stopping and removing the container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop logger
docker rm logger
Now restart it again with the same volume:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -v "$(pwd)/logs:/logs" --name logger volume-logger
📌 The logs will continue appending to the same app.log file — proving that the volume works!

🎉 Conclusion
✅ You now have a running Python app inside a Docker container, writing persistent logs using Docker Volumes. This is crucial for real-world applications that need to persist data outside the container lifecycle.

Keep exploring Docker volumes for use cases like databases, uploads, and backups! 🧠💡
Happy Containerizing! 🐳💾
